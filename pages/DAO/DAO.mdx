# Foundation

The decentralised organisation that PATH INTEGRAL’s Core Team members are part of, which support the growth of the overall ecosystem.

The Foundation is tasked with bootstrapping the system to ensure that it can survive as a fully decentralized organization. The Foundation employs people to develop the strategies and manage the tasks required to build enough momentum so that PI0 DAO can successfully thrive on its own.

We have assesed MAKER PROTOCOL as one of the best DAO management and governance framework and shall be modeling PI0 on similar standards.

# Scientific Governance

The PI0 Governance Framework will be built on rigorously vetted, reproducible, scientific models created by experts with proven track records in this space.

The Framework itself can be broken down into two major components:

Governance Proposals: Symbolic votes used to poll community sentiment towards specific models or data sources.

Executive Proposals: Used to ratify the Parameters determined by the models and data accepted by Governance Proposals. Executive votes result in state changes inside the Maker Protocol and occur every quarter.

This distinction encourages the governance debate to become a consensus-seeking exercise to reach a compromise, where communication channels force participants to focus on the underlying reasoning, theories, and data of risk assessments, rather than a polarizing popularity contest about specific risk parameters for particular tokens.

In this model, neither the #PI0 holders nor the PI0 Foundation will have any special powers to arbitrarily dictate the risk parameters of the system, they can only affect changes through fact-based, provable, scientific arguments.

# Gradual Decentralization

The PI0 Foundation is committed to true decentralization but the road to decentralization needs to be paved with care to ensure the Foundation has the support it needs to be successful and protect against threats to the long-term goal of decentralization.

It is also crucial to provide maximal stability for partner companies that will integrating with PI0 in various ways, as they need to feel safe there won’t be sudden changes due to rapid decentralization of governance.

The Foundation will drive PI0 towards increased decentralization, with every step opening up more aspects of governance to community control, and eliminating single points of failure.

At the same time, the Foundation will also take responsibility for teaching and providing guidance on how community members can most constructively contribute to governance.

# Philosophy

From its inception, Path Integral will serve as a trustless,  community owned DAO for creative and technical service production.

Inspired by Satoshi’s vision of an egalitarian future, we have long committed to the ideals of permissionless access, distributed security and immutability as the essential components for accelerating access to financial services without concern of discrimination or counter-party risk.

PATH INTEGRAL embraces the tenets of neutrality and trust minimisation by offering a free and secure decentralised protocol, accessible to anyone in the world.

In the spirit of continued innovation and platform evolution PATH INTEGRAL core team members will strive toward equitable protocol development and continued education of the expanding Community.

As such, PATH INTEGRAL enshrines The DAO as a publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities.
