# Foundation

The decentralised organisation that PATH INTEGRALâ€™s Core Team members are part of, which support the growth of the overall ecosystem.

The Foundation is tasked with bootstrapping the system to ensure that it can survive as a fully decentralized organization. The Foundation employs people to develop the strategies and manage the tasks required to build enough momentum so that PI0 DAO can successfully thrive on its own.
