**PATH INTEGRAL** is a dao building a plug and play pipeline to design and tell stories from our imagination to your reality.

We are developing a decentralised and modular ecosystem to enable self-sustainable and constantly optimized communities of talent for high end content production supported by innovations in Decentralised Finance.

Emmerging building blocks present an opportunity to re-imagine work ecosystems to unlock true potential for talent and clients. When out of private beta after completion of our first inhouse project, this ecosystem will be available as an open source tool for organizations providing project-based services.

This is version 0.1 to be updated regularly.
