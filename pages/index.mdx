**PATH INTEGRAL** is a dao building an ecosystem to design and tell stories from our imagination to your reality.

We are developing a decentralised and modular ecosystem to enable self sustainable and constantly optimised communities of talent for production of high end CGI and VFX for movies + games production as services supported by innovations in Decentralised Finance.

The tools available today present an opportunity to re imagine work ecosystems to unlock true potential for talent and clients, therefore, we call PI0 'the Future of work' protocol. When out of private beta after completion of our first inhouse project this ecosystem will be available as an open source tool for organizations providing project based services.

this is VERSION 0.1 to be updated regularly as it should not be one persion's vision...
