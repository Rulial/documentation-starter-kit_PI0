# VIRTUAL PRODUCTION

we create stage-like digital environments to enable filmmakers to harness the creative opportunities made possible by virtual production in ways that feel entirely familiar. Through virtual reality, we make it possible to scout virtual locations, set up shots, and capture performances in camera as if they were being filmed on a live action stage. We enable filmmakers to place cameras, lights, dollies and other familiar equipment within the virtual environment while giving them real-world equivalents that closely emulate the tools they use every day. And, by enabling everyone on the shoot to see and react to things in real-time, gut-level, instinctual responses continue to drive instantaneous art choices in the digital world just as they would on a live action set.
