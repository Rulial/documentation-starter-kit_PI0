Virtual Reality (VR) transports your audience to other places, moments or experiences in a way that is unparallelled in any other medium. With high quality VR the viewer is so entirely immersed in their virtual surroundings that they momentarily forget the real world around them. This is called ‘presence’. 

VR content is experienced wearing a headset, from basic models like the Google Cardboard to high end versions such as the Oculus Quest 2, Rift, HP Reverb or the Valve Index which allow the viewer to interact with the environment around them.
