## AR STACK

<br />

Augmented Reality (AR) is a way of bringing digital content into the real world. Whereas Virtual Reality removes the viewer from their surroundings and places them in an artificially created environment, AR overlays digital media onto the real world around the viewer.

You’ve probably come across AR already without noticing it – Snapchat’s animated emojis, Instagram’s stickers/filters and Pokémon Go are all mainstream examples.

We produce WebAR, App based AR (iOS and Android) and social AR such as Snaplenses, and Spark AR.
